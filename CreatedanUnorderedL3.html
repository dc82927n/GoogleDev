  <p>Create an unordered list! Make a list of the three web languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
  <ul>
  <li> HTML </li> 
  <li> CSS  </li>
  <li> JavaScript </li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>


<!--
Notice that I started the list with <ul>. <ul> stands for unordered list and is used to contain the list. The list elements, <li>, are children of the unordered list. Each bullet point is its own <li> and the <li> elements must be children of the <ul> - they can't be placed on their own.1

As I mentioned before, there's another kind of list: an ordered list. Try switching the <ul> for an <ol> to see how it looks!

1 Actually, you might find that you can make an <li> element appear on the page without putting it inside a <ul> or <ol>. Just because this works doesn't mean that you should ever do this. It's the equivalent of writing a sentence with bad grammar - most people will probably understand what you mean but some people will get confused. In this case, "people" are browsers and "confused" means "render your website incorrectly."
